# Chicago-Crime-Dashboard
A dash Board using Tableau to analyze and visualize Chicago City Crime Dataset

## Problem
There has an abundance of crimes committed on a daily basis in Chicago, one of the most populated states in the United States. In this project, we use Chicago Crime dataset which reflects reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2018 to 2022. Our goal is to help the Chicago police department and local public by identifying the most occurring crimes, observe the trend over the years, and find the highly prone crime areas.

## Dataset 
Data Source: The Chicago Crimes Dataset is available [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2022/9hwr-2zxp/data)

## Tools: 
Data wrangling and analysis were conducted using MySQL, and the visual representation was achieved with Tableau dashboards.

## Key Findings: 
-**Crime Count**: From 2008 to 2022, Chicago reported a total of 1,190,000 crime cases.
-**Most Common Crimes:** Theft and Battery emerged as the most prevalent crimes.
-**Peak Crime Times:** Rather than the early hours, midday and midnight have the highest crime rates, with the reasons varying by year, month, and location.
-**Neighborhood Safety Metrics:** "Edison Park" records the lowest crime numbers. However, "West Garfield Park" has the highest arrest rate at 36.36%, and "West Glen" has the lowest at 5.92%.
-**Crime Hotspots:** Streets, apartments, and residences are where most crimes occur. Theft is prevalent on streets around 8 PM and midnight, while apartments and residences frequently report domestic crimes like battery.
